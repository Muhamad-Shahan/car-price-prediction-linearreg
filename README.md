# Car Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how Linear Regression can be used to predict the selling price of a car based on various attributes. It's a practical machine learning application designed to understand the factors influencing car prices and to develop a model that generalizes well to unseen data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes key features such as:

- `Car_Name`: Name of the car
- `Year`: Year of manufacture
- `Selling_Price`: Price at which the car is being sold (target)
- `Present_Price`: Current ex-showroom price of the car
- `Kms_Driven`: Distance driven in kilometers
- `Fuel_Type`: Type of fuel (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
- `Seller_Type`: Type of seller (Dealer/Individual)
- `Transmission`: Type of transmission (Manual/Automatic)
- `Owner`: Number of previous owners

## Workflow
1. **Data Exploration & Visualization**  
   - Summary statistics  
   - Feature correlations  
   - Outlier analysis

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Categorical encoding  
   - Feature selection  
   - Handling skewed features

3. **Model Development**  
   - Linear Regression model  
   - Train-test split  
   - Model fitting and prediction

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - RÂ² Score  
   - Visual analysis of actual vs predicted prices

## Results
The Linear Regression model produced accurate predictions for car prices, showing a strong linear relationship between selected features and the target variable. This project lays the groundwork for more advanced regression techniques.
